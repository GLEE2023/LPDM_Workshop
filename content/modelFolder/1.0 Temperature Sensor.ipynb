    "\n",
    "## <span style=\"color:tomato\"> Overview </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The TMP117 is a digital temperature sensor, providing a 16-bit temperature result with a best case accuracy of up to $\\pm 0.1 ^{\\circ}C$, a worst case accuracy of up to $\\pm 0.3 ^{\\circ}C$, and a resolution of $\\pm 0.0078 ^{\\circ}C$. The TMP117 effectively measures the temperature of its surroundings, namely the LunaSat. In order to measure the temperature of an object further away, the TPIS 1385 thermopile sensor is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span style=\"color:tomato\"> Configurations </span>\n",
    "#### The sensor has several primary configurable modes:  \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **Continuous Conversion Mode**</span>: The sensor continuously performs temperature conversions and updates a result register after each conversion. Following the conversion, the sensor enters a standby period. During active conversion, the sensor consumes about 135Î¼A and only 1.25Î¼A in standby. The lengths of the active and standby periods are configurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **Shutdown Mode (SM)**</span>: When entering shutdown mode, the sensor aborts any ongoing conversions and enters a low-power shutdown mode. In shutdown mode, the sensor still continues to consume power. The device typically only consumes 250nA in shutdown mode.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **One-Shot Mode (OS)**</span>: The sensor conducts a \"single\" temperature conversion and then goes into shutdown mode. There is no standby period in this mode. Therefore the only configurable setting is the number of conversions to be sampled and averaged before being passed to the data register. This mode is most appropriate for the GLEE lunar mission because it balances power consumption with meeting temporal sampling requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\">**Therm and Alert Modes**</span>: The therm and alert modes compare results after every conversion against a high and a low value, and will set respective alert flags if the temperature passes either. While only either the Therm mode or the Alert mode can be active, the temperature sensor can be in one or the other in addition to the One-Shot Mode and Continuous Conversion Mode. Due to the nature of the flight code, we will not be including these in the configurations. Samples will be collected regardless of if they exceed the threshold, but these samples can be filtered with post-processing once they are transmitted from the Moon to Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature sensor accumulates conversions and reports the average at the end of each conversion cycle. The possible averaging options are 0, 8, 32, or 64 conversions per conversion cycle. \n",
    "* The default TMP117 setting from startup is 8 averages and a conversion cycle of 1s. By default, the Alert mode will be active. \n",
