    "# `1.6 Microcontroller (Processor) ðŸ’»`\n",

    "## <span style=\"color:tomato\"> Overview </span>\n",
    "- The ATmega328P is a low power, 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR architecture, which allows the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span style=\"color:tomato\"> Configurations </span>\n",
    "The ATmega328P allows for a variety of sleep modes for power and noise reduction.\n",
    "- **Active Mode**: The MCU runs as normal with all peripherals active. The overall power consumption depends on several factors, such as operating voltage, operating frequency, loading of I/O pins, switching rate of I/O pins, code executed, and ambient temperature, though operating voltage and frequency are the dominating factors. \n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Idle Mode**: Stops the MCU's CPU by disabling the CPU and FLASH clocks while allowing other clocks, counters, and system interrupts to function.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **ADC Noise Reduction Mode**: Disables the CPU, I/O, and FLASH clocks, which improves the noise environment for the ADC.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Power-down Mode**: Halts all generated clocks, allowing operation of only asynchronous modules.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Power-save Mode:**: Identical to Power-down, but keeps the Timer/Counter2 running to enable wakeup from timer interrupts.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Standby Mode**: Identical to Power-down, but keeps the Oscillator running.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Extended Standby Mode**: Identical to Power-save, but keeps the Oscillator running.\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Power Reduction Register**: Allows individual shutting down of several components for power reduction: Two-Wire Interface (TWI), Timers 0, 1, and 2, the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), the Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter (USART), and the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).\n",
    "###\n",
    "- **Additional Power Saving**: For additional power saving, the ADC, Analog Comparator (AC), Internal Voltage Reference (IVR), Watchdog Timer, Brown-out Detector (BOD), Port Pins, and On-chip Debug System can all be disabled or configured to use minimum power.\n",
    "###\n",
    "From the following options, create at least one configuration by choosing the mode, any components to disable, and how long the sensor will spend in that configuration (in seconds) before moving into the following in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modes**: {ACTIVE, IDLE, ADC_NOISE_REDUCTION, POWER_DOWN, POWER_SAVE, STANDBY, EXTENDED_STANDBY}  \n",
    "**Disable components**: {TWI, TIMER0, TIMER1, TIMER2, ADC, USART,   SPI, AC, IVR, WATCHDOG, BOD, PINS, DEBUG}  "
