    "The TPIS1S1385 is a compact, low-power thermopile for temperature measurement of remote objects. It is not reconfigurable as it operates passively in response to temperature differences without an active control mechanism, so we will simply plot out its constant power and data usage when a temperature difference is detected.\n",

    "The sensor has a single configuration, \"TP_ON\", indicating its active state, and although there is no explicit \"TP_OFF\" configuration, it is included to demonstrate no power and data usage when the sensor is not actively used. The \"TP_ON\" state is a continuous state, meaning that once the thermopile is turned on, it cannot be turned off. Thus trying to set the mode to \"TP_OFF\" after \"TP_ON\" is not possible.\n",
