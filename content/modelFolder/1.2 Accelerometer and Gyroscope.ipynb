    "# `1.2 Accelerometer & Gyroscope Configurations ðŸ”„`\n",

    "The MPU-6000 is a motion tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a digital motion processor all in a small 4x4x0.9mm package. The MPU-6000 features three 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing the gyroscope outputs\n",
    "and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs. An on-chip 1024 Byte First In First Out (FIFO) buffer is there where new samples are added at the end and older samples are overwritten when the buffer is full. This buffer helps lower system power consumption by allowing the system processor to read the sensor data in bursts and then enter a low-power mode as the MPU collects more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Note:</u>**\n",
    "**GLEE currently has no plans to add functionality to the code such that the gyroscope can be used. We will only be using the accelerometer for now, the inclusion of the gyroscope is informational only**\n",

    "#### The sensor has several primary configurable modes: \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **Accelerometer Only**</span>: The sensor offers orientation detection and signaling, tap detection for user input and gesture recognition, and user-programmable interrupts based on acceleration events. The operating current is 500 ÂµA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **Accelerometer Low Power**</span>: Wakes the sensor to take a single accelerometer sample  at a given frequency. The current at 1.25Hz is 10ÂµA, at 5Hz is 20ÂµA, at 20Hz is 70ÂµA , and at 40Hz is 140ÂµA. These values indicate the amount of current consumed by the accelerometer when operating in the low power mode at specific output data rates (Hz). Frequency refers to the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time, typically measured in hertz (Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\"> **Gyroscope Only**</span>:  The sensor works as a gyroscope only. The gyroscope features integrated 16-bit ADCs for simultaneous sampling, enhanced temperature stability to reduce the need for user calibration, and improved low-frequency noise performance. It also offers a digitally-programmable low-pass filter. The operating current is 3.6mA and has a standby current of 5ÂµA. Additionally, the gyroscope comes factory-calibrated for reliable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\">**Accelerometer and Gyroscope**</span>: The sensor works as both an accelerometer as well as a gyroscope. The gyroscope and accelerometer take samples at different rates. The data value assumes a sample rate of the accelerometer, 1 kHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:orange\">**Gyroscope DMP**</span>: Similar to a Gyroscope configuration with an additional Digital Motion Processor (DMP) engine that supports 3D Motion Processing and gesture recognition algorithms. Due to the DMP, the sensor has built-in capabilities to process motion data and recognize specific gestures or motion patterns.\n",

    "When everything is enabled the maximum operating current is 3.9 mA.\n",
