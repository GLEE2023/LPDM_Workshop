    "We have explored the power usage of many components on the LunaSat, but we have not considered all of them yet. Other components that consume power include the <span style=\"color:orange\">LEDs</span> and the <span style=\"color:orange\">EEPROM module</span>. Unfortunately the power is not very easy to predict for these components, and so the true power usage will have to be measured in the future. Additionally, the power consumption of the <span style=\"color:orange\">EEPROM module</span> is dependent on how often data is read to and written to memory in the component, which is in turn dependent on the sampling rates you choose, the limitations imposed on those sampling rates, and the space available for data buffers in microcontroller memory. We will instead use an estimate of the power usage for now. In the cell below, you can choose how often the LEDs blink, if at all. LEDs may be used to support localization techniques, but they currently do not serve a purpose and will not be included in your chosen configurations. Another component that consumes power is the <span style=\"color:orange\">microcontroller</span>. We will consider its power usage with the other sensors and with the RF system separately.\n",
